Overview
This project undertakes a comprehensive analysis of healthcare data with a special focus on dialysis centers. By examining various KPIs, we aim to understand patient trends, operational efficiencies, and market dynamicsâ€”ultimately providing actionable insights for improved healthcare delivery.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
KPI 1: Number of Patients across Summaries
Observations:

Dominance of Survival Summary: With nearly 1.938 million patients, survival outcomes are a primary focus.

Key Metabolic Parameters: "Serum Phosphorus" and "Hypercalcemia summaries" each record over 600,000 patients, highlighting critical metabolic monitoring.

Vascular Access Consideration: Both "Catheter" and "Fistula summaries" have around 600,000 patients, essential for treatment planning.

Lower Frequency Metrics: "Hospitalization" and "Transfusion summaries" report approximately 495K and 422K patients, respectively.

Niche Metrics: The "nPCR summary" shows only 1,000 patients, suggesting limited applicability.

KPI 2: Profit vs. Non-Profit Stats
Observations:

Profit Dominance: A significant 89% of the organizations are profit-oriented, underlining a strong focus on revenue generation.

Non-Profit Representation: Only 11% of organizations are non-profit, reflecting a smaller portion of healthcare centers focusing solely on patient welfare.

KPI 3: Chain Organizations & Total Performance Score
Observations:

Market Leaders: DaVita and Fresenius Medical Care lead with performance scores of 119 and 118, respectively, indicating their dominant position within the industry.

Score Distribution: A vast majority of smaller organizations score minimally, suggesting a concentration of expertise and quality with top providers.

Dialysis Coverage: Approximately 99% of dialysis stations offer In-center Hemodialysis, stressing the need for diversification towards peritoneal dialysis.

KPI 4: Dialysis Stations Statistics
Observations:

Ownership Mix: Around 91% of dialysis stations are owned by chains, while only 9% are independent centers.

Home Hemodialysis Training: Only 29% of stations offer training for home-based hemodialysis, presenting an opportunity for service expansion.

Service Disparity: There is a noted imbalance between stations offering peritoneal dialysis versus those that do not.

KPI 5: Total Category Text - As Expected
Observations:

High Facility Counts: Categories like Hospitalization (6,818), Fistula (6,517), PPPW (6,659), and Survival (5,966) indicate their prominence in healthcare management.

Lower Count: The SWR category shows the lowest facility count at 3,623, hinting at areas that might benefit from increased attention.

Below is an illustration of facility counts across categories:

Category	Facility Count
SWR	3,623
Infection	5,011
Survival	5,966
Transfusion	6,108
Fistula	6,517
PPPW	6,659
Hospitalization	6,818
KPI 6: Average Payment Reduction Rate
Observations:

This metric tracks the rate at which payments are reduced, providing insights into cost-saving measures and identifying factors that might contribute to financial efficiencies in healthcare facilities.

Dashboards & Data Tools
The analysis was supported and visualized through multiple tools, including:

Excel Dashboard

Tableau Dashboard

Power BI Dashboard

MySQL for data exploration and management

Each tool provided a unique interface for data interaction and further analysis.

Challenges & Solutions
Data Cleaning:

Initial Approach: Null values were first replaced using average values, as the columns were numerical.

Final Strategy: To maintain consistency with KPI specifications (especially for count-based metrics), nulls were replaced with zeros, ensuring data integrity.

Conclusion
The analysis revealed several critical insights:

Market Dynamics: Chain-owned dialysis centers dominate the sector, indicating standardized practices and efficiencies.

Treatment Preferences: In-center hemodialysis is overwhelmingly common, though there is scope for increasing peritoneal dialysis options.

Training Opportunities: Limited availability of home hemodialysis training signals an area for potential growth.

Operational Focus: High facility counts in categories like hospitalization and PPPW confirm their importance, while categories with lower counts (e.g., SWR) suggest areas needing improvement.
