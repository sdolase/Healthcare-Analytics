# Healthcare-Analytics

This repository contains the analysis and dashboards for our Healthcare Analytics Project. We focused on key performance indicators (KPIs) related to dialysis care to drive insights for better healthcare delivery.

Project Overview
Objective: Analyze healthcare data focused on dialysis metrics.

KPIs: Evaluated patient counts, profit vs. non-profit status, performance of chain organizations, dialysis station statistics, facility counts, and payment reduction rates.

Dashboards: Visualized findings using Excel, Tableau, Power BI, and MySQL.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
KPI 1: Patient counts across various summaries (e.g., survival, serum phosphorus, hypercalcemia).

KPI 2: Profit vs. non-profit organization statistics.

KPI 3: Performance scores of chain organizations like DaVita and Fresenius.

KPI 4: Dialysis station statistics, including ownership and service offerings (e.g., home hemodialysis training).

KPI 5: Facility counts across different categories (e.g., hospitalization, fistula, survival).

KPI 6: Average payment reduction rate, offering insights into financial efficiency.

Challenges & Solutions
Data Cleaning: Initially replaced null values with averages; later switched to zeros to maintain consistency with count-based KPIs.
